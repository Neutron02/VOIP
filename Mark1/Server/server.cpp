// Include necessary libraries and headers
// For example: <iostream>, <cstring>, <vector>, socket libraries, threading libraries if multithreading is implemented.

// Define global constants, such as:
// - BUFFER_SIZE: Size of the buffer for audio data.
// - SERVER_PORT: Port on which server is listening.
// - MAX_CLIENTS: Maximum number of clients the server will handle.

// Define global variables or structures, if necessary.
// For instance, a structure to manage client connections, socket descriptor, list or vector of connected clients, etc.

// Function prototypes, if you decide to modularize your code. For instance:
// - initializeServer(): Set up the server to listen for connections.
// - acceptClient(): Accept a new client connection.
// - routeAudio(): Receive audio data from one client and send it to another.
// - closeConnection(): Close the connection with a client.
// - handleError(): A generic function to handle errors.

int main() {
    // Initialization phase
    // - Initialize the socket system.
    // - Bind to a port and start listening for client connections.

    // Main loop
    // - Listen for incoming client connections.
    // - Accept new clients and possibly spawn a new thread or use non-blocking IO or select/poll mechanism to manage multiple clients.
    // - Receive audio data from the sender client.
    // - Route the received audio data to the receiving client.

    // Cleanup phase
    // - Close all client connections.
    // - Close the server socket.
    // - Cleanup any resources or systems you initialized.
    
    return 0;
}

// Function definitions
// If you modularize your code into separate functions, you'd define them here.
// This can keep the main() function clean and make the program more maintainable.
